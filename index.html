      <p> Hi my name is Joetta Hall, I am originally from Los Angeles, CA. I moved to Atlanta in December 2019, and I have a lot of family here. What inspired me to become a software developer was the creativity I have seen others developers have.  They have created things that can help the world become more efficient and that’s something I want to be part of. I know this will not be an easy skill to develop but nothing in life is easy, challenges exposes your weaknesses. Once you learn your weaknesses its your choice to make it into a strengthen, which in return will shape the person you are supposed to become.  That’s the only way you can move on in life overcoming adversity. Furthermore, I hope to meet other creative minds and build strong friendships! A fun fact about me I also do photography:</p>
